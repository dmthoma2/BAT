Binance Auto-Trader - An automated algorithm trading application for

Binance Auto-Trader (BAT) is a configuration file driven console 
application with a modular service oriented architecture back end. 
This back end is coded to handle various trading algorithms as 
well as actual trade execution and price information API calls.

Initial Algorithms
1) "REBALANCE": Rebalancing stock market portfolios has proven 
consistently over time to improve risk adjusted returns and provide
alpha during times of high market volatility.  Rebalancing 
portfolios ensures that assets relatively over performing are sold
and assets that are relatively under performing are bought to bring
the portfolio into its targeted balance.  This strategy when applied
consistently is contrarian to the market and ensures the portfolio 
follows the adage "Buy Low Sell High".  While quarterly rebalancing
is recommended in the stock market, a much shorter interval can be 
utilized in cryptocurrencies due to extremely low trading expenses 
and extremely high market volatility.
